# SpeedCrunch GitHub schemes

This is a set of color schemes for [SpeedCrunch](https://heldercorreia.bitbucket.io/speedcrunch/) with the GitHub VS Code theme's colors.

## Installation

Copy the theme files (ending in .json) to your SpeedCrunch color schemes
directory. The directories for each platform are listed below. Close and reopen
SpeedCrunch and it should show the new color schemes in your color scheme menu.

The following instructions are adapted from the [SpeedCrunch user manual](https://heldercorreia.bitbucket.io/speedcrunch/advanced/colorschemeformat.html).

Color scheme files are loaded from the following directory:

- Windows: `C:/Users/<USERNAME>/AppData/Roaming/SpeedCrunch/color-schemes`
- Linux/Unix: `~/.local/SpeedCrunch/color-schemes`
- OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/SpeedCrunch/color-schemes`

When using a portable version of SpeedCrunch on any operating system, additional color schemes are loaded from the color-schemes subdirectory in the portable application directory.
